        Upwork Sales Process To Increase Conversion By 125% (Part 2A: Structure

          Now that you have gone through the setting process and have that
          dialed in, we can move to the fun part - Closing. Getting deals
          signed, getting payments sent.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Now, before we get into how to structure and handle sales calls, we
          first need to understand what they are and what their purpose is.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Most people think that sales are about pushing and pressuring the
          client nonstop until they finally decide to buy. Using sleazy tactics
          and never taking no for an answer, convincing them until they finally
          say yes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          But this is just going to lead to chargebacks, bad reviews, and
          clients that didn’t really want to work with you.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">It’s the wrong mentality.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The highest conversion rate comes from being genuine. That’s why it is
          so important that you are actually providing a high-quality service
          and not scamming people. Because if you are convinced that you will
          provide them a ton of value, a sales call is just about explaining
          that to them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          So the right way to look at it is as a conversation, you are not
          trying to sell them anything.. Ask as many questions as possible,
          understand what they are looking for, and IF AND ONLY IF it makes
          sense, explain to them what you can do to solve their problem.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You see how you are not forcing your solution on them but rather
          listening to their problem and explaining to them why you are the
          perfect fit to solve it.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
          Prioritize relationships over sales.

          Sales Call Structure
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The structure that has led to the highest conversion rate and the most
          success with sales has been to divide into 2 separate 30-minute calls.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>
            The first one is a discovery call where you simply want to get as
            many details about the project and the client as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            If they qualify, a second call is booked where you go through a
            detailed proposal with them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Ideally, we want to gather information about their project and send
          them over some assets to warm them up BEFORE the call.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          We have a whole separate guide and workflow schematic that teaches you
          how to build this out.

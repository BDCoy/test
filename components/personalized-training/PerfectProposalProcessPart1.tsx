        Perfect Proposal Process (Part 1: Why Send Proposals?)

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          So you have created a perfect profile - you have a powerful title, a
          good headshot, a few testimonials, a complete portfolio, and a sales
          letter description.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You’ve already positioned yourself above 95% of freelancers when a
          client sees your profile, but…
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          We now need to get them to actually see your profile.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Sure, you can wait around to receive job invites (your profile is now
          optimized for that) but you would be missing out on dozens of
          potential jobs EVERY single week.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You have to understand that most clients post a job and wait for the
          proposals to come in, they don’t waste their time searching the
          platform for the right freelancer.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You could be missing out on a ton of perfect jobs here!

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Now, you have to spend connects to send proposals, and connects cost
          money.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          But, let’s do the math. 300 connects = 50$. An average job post could
          cost around 10 connects, let's say 15 to be extra conservative. This
          means you can send out 20 proposals.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Our average reply rate is 10-20% which means 2-4 proposals get
          responded to and we get on a call.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Our average sales call conversion rate is 25-50%, so that’s 1-2 closed
          clients.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          With a minimum ticket of $1000, that is WAY above what we originally
          spent, $50.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Of course, at the beginning it’s very scary.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You don’t know how well you are going to convert, you don’t know if
          your proposal structure is correct, you don’t know if you’re
          submitting to the right job posts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          But at the end of the day, it’s the only way to scale and absolutely
          double, triple, quadruple your revenue on Upwork.

        Upwork Sales Process To Increase Conversion By 125% (Part 1: Setting)

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          So you created a perfect Upwork profile, have an amazing proposal
          structure, and are sending it out to new job posts nonstop!
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          A client sees and responds to your proposal, what now???
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The biggest mistake we see here is freelancers thinking they certainly
          will be hired and therefore they don’t put effort into the
          conversation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
          WRONG. Your sales process is going to be the difference between a 50
          and 10% conversion rate. That can mean 5 times the clients and 5 times
          the revenue. The difference between making 5k or 25k a month.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Ok, now that you have understood the importance of it, let’s dive into
          it.

          The Main Objective: Book a Call
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The absolute main objective when chatting with a potential client on
          Upwork is to book a call.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Every single one of your messages should end prompting the client to
          book a call.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Here are some example lines to ask for a call:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>
            “Why don’t we schedule a quick call to go over this in more detail
            to make sure we are aligned?”
          </li>
          <li>
            “Would love to get to know more about you and the project over a
            quick call. Let’s schedule something.”
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Why? People don’t care about you until they know that you care.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          A face-to-face approach allows you to build a more personal
          relationship. It humanizes things. You can frame it as “I am a partner
          that’s here to help you achieve your objectives. Not just a service
          provider.”
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You can probe and ask questions about the project that will show that
          you actually care about the project, that you understand the technical
          capabilities needed to build the project, and get all the details to
          estimate costs and timelines.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You can fight any objections, concerns, or other worries the client
          might have. You can tackle these head-on and get a direct response.

          Essential Guidelines to Follow
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Speed is KING:</strong> Reply to any messages immediately.
            The client is online, responsive, and with buying intent. Answer any
            questions they might have and try to book a call as soon as
            possible!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Be Detailed:</strong> Whenever the client asks you a
            question, go above and beyond. Tackle their immediate concern and
            all the possible follow-up questions they might have. Shower them
            with value!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reassure the Client:</strong> Give the client constant
            reassurance that you are the perfect candidate for the job. Refer to
            similar projects you’ve worked on, the results you’ve helped other
            companies achieve, and the solutions you implemented.
          </li>

          Example Conversation
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Here’s an example to show how you can reassure the client and portray
          your expertise:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-gray-400 text-gray-700">
          <p>
            <strong>The client:</strong> “Our previous freelancer created a
            beautiful website for us, but it loaded so slowly that users hated
            it!”
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>You:</strong> “Website speed is absolutely essential. This
            reminds me of the time I worked with (company). They had a 6-second
            load speed and had been trying to solve it for months. I came in and
            fixed (the solution you provided) that resulted in (result your work
            yielded).”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          It’s subtle enough so that you aren’t being arrogant, but direct
          enough to build confidence in your skills and expertise.
        </p>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
          If you understand and implement these core principles in your sales
          process, you’ll see a significant boost in your conversion rate.

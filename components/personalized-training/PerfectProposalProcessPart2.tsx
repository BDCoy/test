          Getting replies to your proposals is a volume game - you need to know
          that a majority of the proposals you send will not get a reply and
          that’s just the cost of doing business.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          But if you have seen Part 1: Why Send Proposals?, you’ll understand
          why it has such a large ROI.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          With that said, we want to have the most optimized and efficient
          process to be able to send out proposals successfully consistently.
          Otherwise you:

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Will spend hours at a time scrolling through useless job posts
            trying to find one that is good, and therefore, not have time to
            send out a lot of proposals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Will throw money out the window by applying to jobs who aren’t the
            best match to your profile.
          </li>

          So I’ll break down how you can find the right jobs while saving you
          hours on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Spoiler alert, it will take more time to set this up at the start. You
          are doing the initial research and setting up the infrastructure so
          that later on everything is on autopilot.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The ROI in the long-term is insane from the few hours time it takes.

          Finding the Right Jobs

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          First thing we need to consider, is what your profile is optimized for
          - you should have set this up on the previous trainings.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          To know where your right jobs are, you need to understand how the
          clients are creating the job posts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Go to your client account and create a demo job post for what our
          clients would be looking for, in this example let’s say I’m looking
          for a game developer for a game built in Unity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Now you can see which job categories are being suggested.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          When you move to the skills page, you’re going to start to tap into
          Upwork’s algorithm and really understand how to meet your ideal
          clients where Upwork is sending them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          A lot of times, clients have no clue what skills to add to the job
          post, because they might not have the technical understanding, and
          also are rolling with whatever Upwork is suggesting to them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
          TIP: Upwork updates this constantly, so it’s good to redo this process
          every month to stay ahead of your competition.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Write down all of the skills on the sheet provided above so you can
          then search the volume and relevancy of the job posts where users
          include them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Now it’s time to actually start searching for job posts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Now that we know what our leads are putting on their job descriptions,
          we can start the search and refining process. Let’s jump into the
          “find a job” page.

          Two Types of Search

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">

          <li>Keyword on job description</li>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Use some initial keywords and add more skills/keywords to the list by
          reading what people mention in the job descriptions that are a good
          fit for you.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Check the volume of job posts with the different keywords and skills
          to find where is the most volume and fit for you.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Set your minimum standards for what type of project you are willing to
          take. Sometimes it will still show some that aren’t a good budget fit,
          but it will filter out most of the noise.

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">Example:</p>

            Start adding filters and scroll through the jobs. This is a

          Adjust Filters for Volume
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Does it have enough volume or too much volume?
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          If there isn’t enough, remove a keyword or other filter. If there’s
          too much, scroll through the job posts and highlight the ones that are
          not relevant at all. Use the advanced search to filter out these
          terms.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          What is the quality of the job posts? How qualified are they?
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Repeat the process to refine your job search and make sure you’re
          targeting the most relevant and high-quality job posts.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          TIP: Sometimes clients aren’t very technical, so they think they need
          someone with a specific skill but really it is irrelevant. For
          example, many clients when looking for a designer add Adobe
          Illustrator as a keyword as it is suggested by Upwork, but the client
          doesn’t care, the design can be made in Figma as well.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
          Now, save the search filters and you’re ready to go.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Check in daily, to go over all of the job posts and continue to send
          proposals to the relevant ones. Remember, this is a volume game, so
          you must stay consistent, it must be every single day.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          And it’s even better if you check in multiple times a day as the less
          time that has passed from the job posting to your proposal, the higher
          chance you have of getting a reply.
        </p>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          We are putting together a lesson called Part 4: Consistency Structure

          proposals.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Apart from this, you will need to know what to send in your proposal!
          What do you even write!
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Luckily, we have already put together a lesson called Part 3: Proposal
          Creation. For those of you who haven’t checked that out, do it before
          sending out any proposals, it’s pivotal.

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          And a final note, remember this is a continuous process. It’s an
          upfront investment of time to have the initial setup and then just a
          checkup on a weekly or monthly basis repeating this process.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          This helps you always stay ahead of the curve and find the best jobs

          Proposal Call (2nd Call)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You need to come into this call with a written proposal containing the
          different milestones, prices, timelines, and descriptions of how
          everything will be built, A-Z.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
          Note: we have a separate guide on how to build a proposal. Coming
          soon…
        </p>

          Starting the Call
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Now, once you are on the call, you want to start it off similarly to
          the first one – a joke, a quick comment/observation, etc. Trying to
          find some common ground to build a relationship.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          After this, get down to business with the yes-no-maybe line:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-gray-400 text-gray-700">
          <p>
            “Hey, so, I am going to go over the proposal now and in the past, I
            have had people that said maybe, or I need to think about it because
            they don’t want to hurt my feelings, and I just don't want you to
            have that same issue. So let’s stick to a yes or a no for this
            call.”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          This eliminates any time-wasting, any “I am going to think about it”
          and then never messaging back. This step is crucial.
        </p>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">
          Going Over the Proposal
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          After that, share your screen and go over the entire proposal. Make
          sure to go through all the milestones, what they would require, what
          they would look like, how the service delivery process works, and
          answer any questions or objections the client might have (pause every
          few minutes to see if they have any questions).
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          It’s important to note here that you shouldn’t show anything related
          to price while you are going over the proposal. The idea here is to
          stack as much value as possible so they see it as a no-brainer offer.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Once everything is extremely clear, share the final price(s). Drop it
          and just sit there, don’t say a word, stay in silence until they say
          what they think.
        </p>

          Handling Objections
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          If they have any objections, reservations, or are not sure they want
          to move forward, here is where you have to dig, dig, dig, and dig more
          to find out where the problem is.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Frame the conversation in a way where you are just trying to
          understand where they are coming from. Then you present things to them
          that you had discussed and that they stated on previous calls that
          doesn’t correlate with them now not wanting to move forward. (“Am I
          misunderstanding something?”)
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
          These are the most common objections, and the ones you want to have a
          predefined response, counterargument, or resources on hand and ready
          to prove otherwise:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Objection - They don’t trust you understand their problems/goals
          </li>
          <li>Objection - They don’t trust the offer is a good fit</li>
          <li>
            Objection - They don’t trust themselves (to execute, support from
            partner, timing)
          </li>
          <li>
            Objection - They don’t trust the investment makes sense/budget
          </li>
        </ul>

          Negotiating Price
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          If it is related to price, simply ask them:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-gray-400 text-gray-700">
          <p>
            “So let’s say the offer was perfect and you did see a clear path to
            ROI, would X$ completely be unreasonable for you? Would it totally
            break the bank? What amount would make sense for you?”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You might have some margin here to negotiate with them and bring the
          price down a bit.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
          Note: Create an objection sheet where you write down a list of every
          objection that a prospect has ever had, and create a response for it.
          This way, you’ll always be ready in the future.

          Closing the Deal
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          If they are ready to move forward, you want to immediately get all of
          their information for the service agreement and invoice on the call:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>Full name</li>
          <li>Physical Address</li>
          <li>Email</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          And if possible, it is 1000% recommended that you directly send them
          the service agreement on the call for them to sign it, and the first
          invoice for them to pay it. Once you get off the call, they might cool
          off, start overthinking, and just backtrack with their decision. We
          don’t want that.

          It is important not only to have a great system and framework in place
          to increase conversions but also to have the correct setup to
          continuously improve the process and the salesman.

          Track KPI’s, record calls, and review them, take notes.

          <li>
            Keep track of the number of calls, rate them after the call, write

          Now, there are a few outlier scenarios that you need to account for:

          Every Upwork freelancer knows that for every job post, there are
          dozens if not hundreds of candidates sending a proposal to try to get
          hired.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          We also know that Clients can search for talent in their Upwork
          dashboard, sort of like a Google for freelancers. And just like on
          Google, if you are not on the first page, you will NEVER get seen, and
          therefore never get invited to jobs.

          After 4 years of banging my head against the wall, trying a million

          You need a two-liner that explains what you do, who you do it for, and
          how you do it in a very specific (don’t be generic), very concise, and
          very engaging manner.

          The reason we make it 2 lines is because when clients see a preview of

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Once a client reads your two-liner, they are going to immediately

          them with remarkable (and if possible, undeniable) proof.

          This means tangible results - # of projects you have worked on, $ you

          At this point, the client is almost convinced that what you are saying
          is true, and you are as good as it seems. But you need to push them
          over the edge.
        </p>

            project like that before.
          </li>
          <li>
            They are bad at communication & transparency. They don’t provide
            updates frequently, and when they do, it is tech jargon that is not
            understandable to the client.
          </li>
          <li>
            They hold their clients hostage. Since clients usually don’t have
            technical expertise, they rely on the freelancer to store the code,
            setup the servers, etc. which gives them the ability to pull the
            plug and ruin everything whenever they want.

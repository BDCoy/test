        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          It is extremely important to take 10-20 minutes before a call to not
          only gather the necessary information but to also recenter yourself
          mentally and come in your best shape to the call.
        </p>

          Your energy matters. Do you know about the 7-38-55 Rule?

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Only 7% of all communication is done through verbal communication, the
          words we speak, whereas the nonverbal component of our daily
          communication, such as the tonality of our voice, make up 38% and 55%,
          your body language and facial expressions.

          This is what you need to do before the call:
        </h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Review the prospect’s information and booking form (if there is one)
          </li>
          <li>
            Calibrate your breathing, 10 deep breaths (in through nose, fill
            stomach)
          </li>
          <li>Be the tide, not the current.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Just because you had a bad day or a bad previous call doesn’t mean it
          should be dragged onto this one.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          You are the one that has done this sales call a million times, not
          them. You are the expert. Lead the call, lead the conversation.

          Starting the Call
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Once you are on the call, start off by keeping it light.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Lead with a joke, a comment or simply asking them about where they are
          located, how the weather is there, etc. You are basically trying to
          find some common ground to build a relationship.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Don’t make it forced, let it flow and come from a place of general
          interest in connecting with someone.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          After this, get down to business (don’t take too long) with the
          following:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-gray-400 text-gray-700">
          <p>
            “So on this call, I am going to ask you questions to get a better
            idea of you, your business, your exact situation, and understand
            exactly if and how I can help you. Alright, so that is really the
            purpose of this call. Then if we see that we are a good fit, we can
            go into more detail on what working together would look like, does
            that sound good?”

          Key Questions for the Call
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Ask them what their motivation is for booking the call, what are
            they looking for?
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify the prospect’s problem-awareness (how long have they been
            looking for a solution, how much impact does this have on their
            business, have they tried any other solutions), how much do they
            understand the technical process to build what they want?
          </li>
          <li>
            Break down the technical side of what they want to build and ask all
            the necessary questions so that you can scope out the project. From
            there show your expertise by giving an initial explanation of how
            you would solve their problem, and how you would build it for them.

          Closing the Discovery Call
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          If by the end of the call, you can clearly see that they are a good
          fit and you can clearly help them, tell them that now that you have
          enough information, you will prepare a proposal for the project and
          that you want to schedule a call to go over the proposal.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          When scheduling this call, state one or two times that you are
          available and see if that works for them. This should be within the
          next few days, ideally the next day. Do not give them a ton of dates
          and times that you are available, NO, you are busy. Do not just send
          them a Calendly link either and expect them to book a call.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Once scheduled, mention that you have a few more questions. Here is
          where we will handle all possible objections before the next call
          where we can simply close!

          Handling Objections & Next Steps
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Ask these questions to close the loop on potential concerns:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li>
            “If we chat next time, and you like all the information you see and
            we can figure out an exact strategy that makes sense, how soon would
            you be looking to start? And how soon are we looking to finish?”
          </li>
          <li>
            “Are you the sole decision maker in this process or on the next call
            will you need to consult with other team members before making a
            decision?”
          </li>
          <li>
            “Assuming it makes sense to you and there is a clear path to help
            you solve your problem/achieve your goal, would it make sense to
            invest X$ amount?”
          </li>
          <li>
            “Assuming it makes sense to you and there is a clear path to help
            you solve your problem/achieve your goal, up to what $ amount are
            you looking to invest?”
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Here you want to give them a potential range of costs based on their
          answers to your questions. This way we avoid getting on a second call
          if they simply do not have the budget.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-4 text-base">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">After the Call</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Now, just because the call has finished, it doesn’t mean your work
          has. The moment after the call could have an even greater impact than
          the call itself.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          As you are not in a meeting, their attention, or desire to work on the
          project could stray elsewhere, which is why it is important to keep in
          close contact.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Follow up with a summary of the points discussed and the plan to
          proceed (written or loom video).
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          It is also highly recommended to attach value such as an educational
          resource, some past case studies, or some reference to another similar
          project that can help them out. The objective here is to grow rapport
          and for them to view you as an expert.
